# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

The purpose of the website is to engage fans, but especially people who have to learn about Animal Farm to engage them in the book whether they like it or not. The app will allow users to click on illustrations of animals referenced throughout the book, giving easy to read summaries of their roles in Animal Farm.

## Use Cases

Hovering over an animal will result in a brief description of the animal
Clicking on the animal will result in the user being transferred into another part of the website, and a page with a detailed description of the character along with photos and such to engage the site user.
Hovering over words that are underlined and highlighted will show a brief definition of the word
You can also donate money to children who have limited access to literature. The donation button will be at the end of every page.
(that’s also the pathing of a user in order)

## Test Case 
User click on thing, website send user to webpage
User hover on thing, website display small display box
I will test these features via peer testing (expand)

## Non Functional Requirements
The app will run at least 60 frames per second and if the person’s device is too bad the website will tell them that the performance is not up to par and the website will not flow smoothly. The app will also have transition animations to make it look more smooth than it probably is.

The app will be easy to use as it is a simple point and click system. If the user is interested in an aspect of the page, they are able to click onto the thing that they want to know more about e.g Old Major and click on it. This website design ensures that the website is easily accessible to anyone.

The website will retain reliability by testing across a variety of devices to ensure that the system requirements for the app aren’t too high and that the resolution of the website will change accordingly to each and every device supported and not bug out. A common issue with websites is that on IPhones especially is that the website tends to have white bars on the side and not fit the resolution, causing the website’s UI to be missized and hard to use.

## Security
The only information that my website will take from the user is their credit card information if they decide to make a charity donation to children in need. This information will be stored securely behind a spreadsheet with a password behind it.


Analyse the key themes that emerged from user feedback and their overall impact on the project.

Evaluate how intuitive and user-friendly the prototype was based on user feedback.

Analyse whether the design elements and accessibility features effectively met user needs.

Evaluate the performance of the prototype, including any issues related to speed, responsiveness, or compatibility.

Analyse the similarities and differences between survey responses and interview insights to identify patterns.

Evaluate the most critical areas for improvement and how they should be addressed in the next sprint.

For this first round of feedback, the critical feedback that I have recieved for this project is that my website looks too simplistic and boring, and the direction and purpose of the website is rather vague, and prior context would probably be required to be able to use the website. The website's design elements weren't up to par due to its boring look, and accessibility features weren't met, as I wasn't sure how I could've approached implementing this feature. The responsiveness and speed of the overall website is quite good, with the buttons being snappy and well animated, and the transition between pages being seemless, but the issue is that my website only supports the Iphone 16, and is not suitable for any other devices yet. I feel like the survey responses were a lot more honest than the interview insights becauase with the survey, they don't feel the need to respond as fast as they would have to in an interview, and also they aren't saying it to me in person which probably makes them more comfortable saying harsher things. The most critical point of improvement is the look of the UI, and it will be addressed by adding more personality and colour to my design.


Evaluate how effectively your product meets the functional and non-functional requirements, including its stated purpose, use case flows, expected behaviours, usability, performance, reliability, and any relevant security considerations.

Evaluate how well your final product meets the intentions outlined in your design brief, including suitability for the target audience and purpose.

Evaluate the extent to which your project addresses relevant social, ethical, and legal responsibilities, particularly in relation to the chosen book and user experience.

Evaluate how effectively you managed your time, resources, and processes throughout the project, including how well you met milestones, adapted to challenges, and maintained consistent progress.

Evaluate how effectively you gathered and responded to user feedback and testing with consideration to how it influenced your design decisions and what aspects of the product still require improvement.

The original stated purpose of this website was to produce a result that would firstly make fans of Animal Farm by George Orwell be able to use a cool website that appealed to them, and to also help students who are studying Animal Farm to be able to take a break from the boring text slab anylasis websites that they are often restricted to. My major functional requirement was to make sure the website was as interactive as possible, and I think that has been met to an acceptable amount, as most of the buttons are fully functional and come with animations, and the Animal Farm can actually be interacted with. In the non-functional area, I think that the use case flow, expected behaviours and performance have all been met. The website works as intended, a basic point and click website which functions at 60 fps on most devices, with no noticable input delay, making the webite smooth and easy to use. The use case flow is also on point, as the user will just be clicking around the Animal Farm in any random order, and then maybe check out the donation page at the end. Now the issues come with the security considerations, as when you are entering your credit card number, there is no censoring around your number, potentially leading to the clients of mine having their card details stolen with a wandering eye. Unfortunately, too, the only security-needing function in my project was the donation feature, but that doesn't really work so the security considerations technically hasn't been met. THe final product meets the intention outlined in my design breif as the target audience, which are probably young adolescences who are either studying for school or people with a special interest in the book. I think my website is suited really well to this age group because my website gets straight to the point and doesn't require a great attention span to be able to use. My paragraphs are around maybe 200-300 words, which shouldn't take people that long to read and should remain within the modern attention span. My webiste takes on the relevant social and ethical responsibilites, as it is stressed that the book's ideas are not to be romanticised, and is a massive jab at the Stalinist reigime. The legal responsibilites haven't been met because as the book was made in America, the copyright still applies as it hasn't been 95 years since George Orwell died, and this website doesn't really work under fair dealing, unfortunately meaning that this website is technically illegal. During my assessment, I did manage my time well, but not my resources. I was focusing too much on the parts of my website that weren't that hard, as I was following stupid YouTube tutorials which weren't even related to the buttons I was making, which did indeed waste a lot of mental energy and time. I adapted to many challenges throughout the creation of this website, as sometimes, Figma was a rather annoying website and would randomly lock things together, put things in different layers, etc. To adapt to these issues, I had to really use my critical thinking and think about why these mini hinderances were happening. I got bashed pretty bad during user feedback, as there was a great amount of product ambuigity around my website, which led me to having to add very clear indicators of what my website is about with bolded titles and such.
