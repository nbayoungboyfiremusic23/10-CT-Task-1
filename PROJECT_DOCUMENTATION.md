# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

The purpose of the website is to engage fans, but especially people who have to learn about Animal Farm to engage them in the book whether they like it or not. The app will allow users to click on illustrations of animals referenced throughout the book, giving easy to read summaries of their roles in Animal Farm.

## Use Cases

Hovering over an animal will result in a brief description of the animal
Clicking on the animal will result in the user being transferred into another part of the website, and a page with a detailed description of the character along with photos and such to engage the site user.
Hovering over words that are underlined and highlighted will show a brief definition of the word
You can also donate money to children who have limited access to literature. The donation button will be at the end of every page.
(that’s also the pathing of a user in order)

## Test Case 
User click on thing, website send user to webpage
User hover on thing, website display small display box
I will test these features via peer testing (expand)

## Non Functional Requirements
The app will run at least 60 frames per second and if the person’s device is too bad the website will tell them that the performance is not up to par and the website will not flow smoothly. The app will also have transition animations to make it look more smooth than it probably is.

The app will be easy to use as it is a simple point and click system. If the user is interested in an aspect of the page, they are able to click onto the thing that they want to know more about e.g Old Major and click on it. This website design ensures that the website is easily accessible to anyone.

The website will retain reliability by testing across a variety of devices to ensure that the system requirements for the app aren’t too high and that the resolution of the website will change accordingly to each and every device supported and not bug out. A common issue with websites is that on IPhones especially is that the website tends to have white bars on the side and not fit the resolution, causing the website’s UI to be missized and hard to use.

## Security
The only information that my website will take from the user is their credit card information if they decide to make a charity donation to children in need. This information will be stored securely behind a spreadsheet with a password behind it.
